# VisionGuard – Smart Retail Maintenance Alert System (Figma Prototype)

**VisionGuard** is a UI/UX prototype for an AI-powered smart maintenance alert system designed for large retail environments such as shopping malls and supermarkets. The goal is to enhance safety and efficiency by detecting in-store hazards (like spills or out-of-order zones) using CCTV and computer vision — and notifying staff in real time via a mobile application.

This project was designed collaboratively using **Figma**, and a detailed walkthrough is available via YouTube.
